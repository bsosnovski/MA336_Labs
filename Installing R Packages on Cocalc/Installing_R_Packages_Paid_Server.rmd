# Installing R packages with Internet Access in Your Project

Let’s say that you want to install the R package `gapminder` (the name of the package will change as you do different labs).

Do the following steps:

1. Go to your `Home` directory.
2. Create a Linux Terminal file in your project or open one that is already in your project.
3. When the prompt appears (>), type in an upper-case letter `R` and press the Return Key. This will start up R.
4. Type in `install.packages("gapminder")`

The following will be displayed:

```
Installing package into ‘/usr/local/lib/R/site-library’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
Warning in install.packages("gapminder") :
  'lib = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"' is not writable
Would you like to use a personal library instead? (yes/No/cancel) 
```

5)	Type `yes`.

```
The following will be display:
Would you like to create a personal library
‘~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1’
to install packages into? (yes/No/cancel)
```

6)	Type `yes` again.

The following will be display:

```
trying URL 'https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/gapminder_0.3.0.tar.gz'
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 2110951 bytes (2.0 MB)

```

This means that the package `gapminder` is installed in your project.

7)	If you type in the command: `.libPaths()`

Then the something similar to the following will be displayed:

```
[1] "/home/user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1"
[2] "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"               
[3] "/usr/lib/R/site-library"                     
[4] "/usr/lib/R/library"                          
>
```

You can see that you have a library directory created in your Cocalc project.

**Note:** The library directory was created and appear [1].

Next time you install another package you will not need to create the library because it is already there (if installed in the `Home` directory of your project).
